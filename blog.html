    <h2>1.What is the Difference between Map, Filter, ForEach and Find?</h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(161, 24, 0)">i.Map==></span> The map() method loops through each element in array and calls the provided function for each element. This method creates a new array and doesn’t alter the original array..</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(161, 24, 0)">ii.Filter==></span> The filter() method in JavaScript creates a new array with the elements that satisfies the provided condition. This method calls a provided function for each element in array and verifies the condition given in the provided function and passes only those elements that satisfy the given condition.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(161, 24, 0)">iii.ForEach==></span> forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(161, 24, 0)">iv.Find==></span> This function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.</p>
    

    <h2 style="color: rgb(2, 38, 11);">2.Difference between localStorage sessionstorage and cookies?</h2>
    <p><span style="color: rgb(92, 9, 97); font-weight: bold;">i.Local storage==></span> Local storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's computer in a key-value pair format and has no expiration date. Data is never transferred to the server and is accessible via JavaScript and HTML5.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(92, 9, 97)">ii.Session storage==></span> Session storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's computer only for the current session, expiring the data on tab close. Data is never transferred to the server and is accessible client-side from the same tab.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(92, 9, 97)">iii.Cookies ==></span> Cookies store small amounts of data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests and their expiration can be set from either server or client. They are primarily used for server-side reading.</p>


    <h2>3.What is an event loop and how does it work?</h2>

    <p>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.</p>
    <br>
    <P>The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event").</P>
