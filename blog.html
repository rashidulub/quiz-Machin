    <h2>1.What is the Difference between Map, Filter, ForEach and Find?</h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">i.Map==></span> The map() method loops through each element in array and calls the provided function for each element. This method creates a new array and doesn’t alter the original array..</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ii.Filter==></span> The filter() method in JavaScript creates a new array with the elements that satisfies the provided condition. This method calls a provided function for each element in array and verifies the condition given in the provided function and passes only those elements that satisfy the given condition.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">iii.ForEach==></span> forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">iv.Find==></span> This function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.</p>
    

    <h2>2.Difference between localStorage sessionstorage and cookies?</h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">i.Local storage==></span> Local storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's computer in a key-value pair format and has no expiration date. Data is never transferred to the server and is accessible via JavaScript and HTML5.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ii.Session storage==></span> Session storage stores a larger amount of data on the client's computer only for the current session, expiring the data on tab close. Data is never transferred to the server and is accessible client-side from the same tab.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">iii.Cookies ==></span> Cookies store small amounts of data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests and their expiration can be set from either server or client. They are primarily used for server-side reading.</p>

    
    <h2>What is event bubble?</h2>
    <p>The Event bubbling in JavaScript is a type of event propagation. The event triggers the innermost target element and consecutively triggers the parent element of the target element in the same hierarchy until it triggers the outermost element.

        It is a procedure where it starts from the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the ancestor elements in the hierarchy.
        
        Let’s get a clear understanding of the flow of event bubbling, where the flow goes from the target element to the outermost element. Below is the view of the flow.</p>

    <h2>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
    <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately.</p>
